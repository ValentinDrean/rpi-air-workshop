# Workshop on crowdsourced data gathering

### Sensor box
Components:
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Particulate sensor SDS011, "Nova PM sensor" (+ flat white cable and USB-plug)
* Temperature/humidity/barometric pressure sensor BME280 (+ flat jumper wires, 4 wide)
* Power bank
* Casing

Once sensors are connected, connect the power bank, and the RPi should power up, indicated by a green light. Booting the device and starting up the bluetooth service takes approximately two minutes.
